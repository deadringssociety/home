We are mathematics students at Ashoka University, and we will be maintaining this site, adding interesting mathematical content we encounter during our explorations of mathematics and allied fields such as Computer Science, Physics, and Finance. 

We will begin with regularly updated notes from a reading circle centered around [_Fields and Galois Theory_](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/FT.pdf) by JS Milne.
